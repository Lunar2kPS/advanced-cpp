# Learning Backlog
- Open questions about Linux:
    - Why did linking against dl work but not against libdl?
    - Why did we need to link against pthread? Is this intentional?
    - Open a GitHub bug/issue for the snap installation issues I found.
    - Perhaps learn about [dlfcn.h](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59727057/purpose-of-using-dynamic-linking-loader-dlfcn-h-instead-of-direct-function-cal) in more detail.
    - Establish a better workflow for determining libraries from standard C++ header (.h) files
