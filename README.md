# Advanced C++ (Learning)
This is a learning project to help my C++ skills rival my Unity/C# skills.

## Purpose
I'm disappointed in Unity's greed, and am deciding to become independent of it by learning an immense amount of C++, giving me much more freedom, and perhaps even potential to use Unreal Engine later on for 3D projects.
For now, I'm sticking with command line, libraries, and 2D projects.

## .NET Hosting from Native C++
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/netcore-hosting
- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/features/native-hosting.md#calling-managed-function-net-5-and-above

üõ†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è **I need to document the setup better,** and make it easier to build. Currently, you need to copy the VS output files from the csharp project into the C++ program's output directory for the .NET hosting to work. (.NET hosting as in, the C++ program will call the C# program!)

## Learning Topics
- JSON saving/loading
- Embedding C# scripting
- File I/O
- Using GUI
- Using EC/ECS
- Cross-platform support (Win/Max/Linux/Pi)
- HTTP Networking
- TCP/UDP Networking
- Rendering realtime 2D pixel art

### üõ†Ô∏è Other TODO's
- Open questions about Linux:
    - Why did linking against dl work but not against libdl?
    - Why did we need to link against pthread? Is this intentional?
    - Open a GitHub bug/issue for the snap installation issues I found.
    - Perhaps learn about [dlfcn.h](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59727057/purpose-of-using-dynamic-linking-loader-dlfcn-h-instead-of-direct-function-cal) in more detail.
    - Establish a better workflow for determining libraries from standard C++ header (.h) files

## Project Dependencies
- [Json for Modern C++ v3.11.2](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/tag/v3.11.2)
    - Downloaded the `include.zip`, deleted the `include` folder and `meson.build` file, and changed the structure to easily `#include "nlohmann/json.hpp"`
