# Advanced C++ Learning -- Game Engine Foundation
**Purpose:** I'm disappointed in the direction that Unity (as a game engine, and as a company) has been going for a while. However, it's taught me so much about game development and API design, and inspired my interest in free, open source, stable, and extensible software with a focus on RPGs for PC and console gaming.

I'm deciding to learn an immense amount of C++, to give me much more freedom as a developer, and perhaps even potential to contribute someday to open source projects like the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/), or learn [Unreal engine](https://www.unrealengine.com).

I hope this project helps to provide a human-friendly, more understandable example of working with many C++ libraries to create a small, specialized game engine.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project TODO's
This project is very much in-progress. Here are some things I'd like to do next:

- Features/Bugs:
    - üî• Learn how to measure performance/memory usage for the GameObjects I've created so far... the grass tiles seem to really eat a ton of performance, and they're barely doing anything!
    - Upgrade the ServiceLocator implementation (in the main program under `/src`) to use templates to let you define the base class that all your systems must inherit from, rather than hard-coding it to use IGameLoopSystems.
    - Dear ImGUI:
        - üêõ I need to somehow fix an issue with Dear IMGUI where Tab/Shift + Tab navigation on the keyboard is not working at all.
        - I want to display float fields without forcing a specific number of decimal places.
        - I want to restrict all GUI to the GLFW window, so they can't get cut off-screen.
        - Dear ImGUI's `ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_RenderDrawData(...)` function throws a 1280 (0x500) GL_INVALID_ENUM OpenGL error during drawing on 64bit Raspberry Pi (OpenGL ES 3.1).
    - C++ learning topics:
        - Measuring performance and/or profiling
        - Rendering realtime 2D pixel art
        - Programming design patterns
    - üêõ For some reason, I've noticed that changing the shader from our source code's "resources" folder updates the already-built builds upon next run. The C++ program should really be reading from the /out folder's resources folder instead.

- C++ Learning:
    - HTTP Networking
    - TCP/UDP Networking

- Documentation:
    - I'd like to better document what this repo shows off. Currently my notes are a little bit unorganized for a first-time viewer.
    - I'd like to upgrade the **Project Dependencies** section,
        - To make it easier to see which methods are used to include the libraries (single-file header, source with existing CMakeLists.txt, etc.)
        - To mention licenses
    - I want to better document what the setup was for getting the [small example UTF-8 program](./small-examples/utf-8) to work.
    - I want to better document how I switch between using OpenGL and OpenGL ES, and the pros/cons of the current approach's use of "pre-assumptions" about the current platform.
    - I want to document and measure the most performant way(s) of calling out to C# code, especially during the game loop.
    - I need to document the setup better for .NET hosting.

See my [backlog](/BACKLOG.md) for other, lower priority learning goals.
