# Advanced C++ (Learning)
This is a learning project to help my C++ skills rival my Unity/C# skills.

**Purpose:** I'm disappointed in the direction that Unity (as a game engine, and as a company) has been going for a while. However, it's taught me so much about game development and API design, and inspired my interest in free, open source, stable, and extensible software with a focus on RPGs for PC and console gaming.

I'm deciding to become independent of Unity by learning an immense amount of C++, to give me much more freedom as a developer, and perhaps even potential to contribute someday to [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) or learn [Unreal engine](https://www.unrealengine.com). For now, I'm sticking with command line, libraries, and 2D projects. I hope this project helps to provide a human-friendly, more understandable example of working with many C++ libraries to create a small, specialized game engine.

## üõ†Ô∏è Platform Support
- ‚úÖ Windows
- ‚úÖ MacOS
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è I currently only own an Intel Mac computer, so I can't support Arm64 (M1/M2) / Apple Silicon computer architecture yet.
- ‚úÖ Linux (tested on Zorin/Ubuntu)
- üõ†Ô∏è Raspberry Pi (tested on arm64)


## üõ†Ô∏è Project TODO's
This project is very much in-progress. Here are some things I'd like to do next:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **I need to document the setup better for .NET hosting,** and make it easier to build. Currently, you need to copy the VS output files from the csharp project into the C++ program's output directory for the .NET hosting to work.
- Open questions about Linux:
    - Why did linking against dl work but not against libdl?
    - Why did we need to link against pthread? Is this intentional?
    - Open a GitHub bug/issue for the snap installation issues I found.
    - Perhaps learn about [dlfcn.h](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59727057/purpose-of-using-dynamic-linking-loader-dlfcn-h-instead-of-direct-function-cal) in more detail.
    - Establish a better workflow for determining libraries from standard C++ header (.h) files
        - https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E86824_01/html/E54772/libdl-3lib.html
        - https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html#LIBRARY


## Learning Topics
- JSON saving/loading
- Embedding C# scripting
- Cross-platform support (Win/Mac/Linux/Pi)
- Using EC/ECS
- File I/O
- Rendering realtime 2D pixel art
- Using GUI
- HTTP Networking
- TCP/UDP Networking


## üõ†Ô∏è Project Dependencies
