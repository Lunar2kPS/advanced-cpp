# Small C++ Program Examples
These small C++ programs demonstrate how to use tools, libraries, and programming design patterns, on a more basic level.

Programs:
- [.NET Hosting](./dotnet-hosting) _(See more info below in this doc)_
- [ECS](./ecs)
- [JSON](./json)
- [OpenGL](./opengl)
- [UTF-8](./utf-8)
- [Programming Design Patterns](./patterns):
    - [Singleton](./patterns/singleton)
    - [Service Locator](./patterns/service-locator)
    - _More coming soon!_
- [Win32 File System Watcher](./win32-file-system-watcher)


## üìú How to Run These Programs
NOTE: Each project has a name, defined near the top of their CMakeLists.txt file with the `project(...)` CMake statement. For example, `project("JsonExample" VERSION 1.0.0)` defines the project name to be "JsonExample".

NOTE: `[CONFIG]` may be either `Debug` or `Release`.

1. Open a (Git) bash terminal to the example project's directory.
2. Run `cmake . -B out -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[CONFIG]`
    - This uses CMake to generate the build system files (like Makefiles, Visual Studio project files, etc.) together with the source files (from `.`, the current directory of your terminal).
3. Run `cmake --build out --config [CONFIG]`
    - This uses the build tool/generator used by CMake to actually build your project.
4. Using the **name of your project** _(see above)_, run your executable:
    - `./out/[CONFIG]/[PROJECT_NAME].exe` _(Windows)_
    - `./out/[PROJECT_NAME]` _(Mac/Linux)_


### C# .NET Hosting Example
‚ö†Ô∏è For the native C# .NET hosting example, you'll need the compiled C# code (.dll, .runtimeconfig.json) next to the C++ program. To do this, run these commands to build and copy over the C# project, **between Steps 3 and 4 above:**
1. Run `dotnet build ../../csharp`
2. Run `./copy-csharp-files.sh [CONFIG]`
